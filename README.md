We should not name our shell scripts and executables too long! Read this!
#Let's take action against long names

## The Problem
It's clear that long file names for executables and scripts cause us many trouble. For example, when we're installing our OS, we have to create partitions. To do so, we type "fdisk" which is atleast 5 characters long. Typing many characters like that means wasting times.

## Soulution

Let's name these file using letter A-Z, a-z or number 0-9, WITHOUT extensions.
a "?" script should list all available commands and tell us what they do.
